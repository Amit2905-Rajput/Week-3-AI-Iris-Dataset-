# Week-3-AI-Iris-Dataset-

**Problem Statement**
The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning and pattern recognition, widely used for classification tasks. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, divided into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The task is to classify these flowers based on four measurable features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width.
The dataset is labeled, with each sample representing a flower of one of the three species. The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the species of an iris flower based on these four features. This kind of classification model is useful in various real-world applications like plant species identification, agriculture, and even biology.

**Dataset Description:**
The Iris dataset is available directly from scikit-learn's datasets module, which simplifies the loading process. The dataset contains 150 observations (rows), 4 features (variables): Sepal Length (cm), Sepal Width (cm), Petal Length (cm), Petal Width (cm)
Target variable (species): Setosa (0), Versicolor (1), Virginica (2)

**Approach and Methodology:**
I have followed a K-Nearest neighbors (KNN) approach to solving a classification problem using machine learning, step by step implementation process is on the jupyter notebook.
Model Evaluation:
•	The model's performance was evaluated using the test set, and the accuracy of the model. I also used the classification report to assess precision, recall, and F1 score for each species.
•	A confusion matrix was plotted to visualize the performance of the model across the three species.

**Making Predictions:**
I tested the trained model on a sample input (flower measurements) and predicted its species.

**Results:**
95% Accuracy
Classification Report showed that Precision, recall, and F1 scores for each species showed that the model is balanced and effective in predicting all three species.
Confusion Matrix showed that the model correctly predicted the species with minimal misclassifications. (Figure 1)

**Benefits of the Model**
Accurate Plant Species Classification
Scalable Approach
Model Explainability
Practical Applications in Agriculture, Ecology and Botany
